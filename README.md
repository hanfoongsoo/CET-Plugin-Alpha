# CET Plugin Alpha

**Structural Trajectory Plugin for AI Systems**

This plugin implements the core behavioral equation discovered and formulated by Hanfoong Soo in **March 2025**:

> **S(t) = C(t) × E(t) × T**  
> _C = Cognition · E = Execution · T = Time_

---

## Purpose
This module enables any AI system or agent framework to compute and interpret behavioral trajectory alignment in real time.

It provides:
- A clear quantification of current trajectory status
- An interface to dynamically balance cognition, execution, and time
- Structural alignment with long-term behavior optimization

---

## CET Variables
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `C(t)`   | Cognitive capacity or task complexity representation (e.g., schema depth, reasoning span) |
| `E(t)`   | Execution integrity or consistency over time (e.g., goal persistence, output stability) |
| `T`      | Temporal window factor (e.g., urgency, consolidation time, delay pressure) |

---

## Output
Returns a trajectory score `S(t)` between 0.0 and 1.0, with one of the following status labels:

- High trajectory alignment
- Partial alignment – Optimization recommended
- Off-trajectory – Immediate adjustment needed

---

## Example
```python
from cet_plugin_alpha import compute_cet_score

example = compute_cet_score({"C": 0.7, "E": 0.6, "T": 0.8})
print(example)
```
